# This is a very casual diary type of app. All you do is register, sign in, and you can write memos to yourself.

This was made in my time as a student in Code Chrysalis.

# How to use
Just go to https://still-escarpment-83446.herokuapp.com/

# How to set up?
Clone my repo, then run
# Yarn install

After all packages are installed, make sure to set up a MongoDB to connect to either on your local machine or to a cloud database service.
Change the URL App.js file or create your own .env file and put your url there. 

# Run Yarn Start

And it should be working on localhost:3000.

# Known Issues
They're in the issues tab. I'm working on it, okay?
If you found a bug, or have an issue, submit an issue!

# Improvements to be made
In the future, this will be a more front-end focused app, with more detail and attention to how the app looks and feels rather than its functionality, as the core functionality is already there. Likely, this app can be tweaked to work for all sorts of things, such as a student's dashboard where you can display schedules, check grades, and so on and so forth (but how boring is that?).
